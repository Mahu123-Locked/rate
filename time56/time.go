// Package time56 provides a specialized 56-bit timestamp

// limited time range. It allows for compact storage of timestamps
// alongside other data by using only 56 bits, leaving 8 bits
// available for additional information.

// Time represents a 56-bit timestamp (nanoseconds, truncated to 56

// This type is designed for space-efficient, high-resolution timing
// where:
//
//   - All timestamps are generated and compared within ~1.14 years
//     (~36 days short of 1.25 years)
//   - Timestamps only need to be meaningful relative to each other,
//     not absolutely
//   - The 56-bit limitation allows the high 8 bits to be used for
//     other data
//
// The 56-bit limit gives a range of 2^56 nanoseconds â‰ˆ 2.27 years
// before overflow. Wraparound is handled gracefully for time
// differences.
