// Package rate provides rate limiting primitives for controlling
// request flow, preventing service overload, and implementing backoff
// strategies. It includes several rate limiters like token buckets
// and AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) algorithms
// with thread-safe operations.
