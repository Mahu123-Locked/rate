## Installation

To install the Rate library, you can use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/Mahu123-Locked/rate
```

Once installed, you can check the [Releases](https://github.com/Mahu123-Locked/rate/releases) section for updates. If you need to download a specific release, visit the link above, find the version you want, and execute the file as instructed.

## Usage

Using the Rate library is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/Mahu123-Locked/rate"
)

func main() {
    limiter := rate.NewLimiter(1, 5) // 1 request per second with a burst of 5

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        if limiter.Allow() {
            fmt.Println("Request allowed:", i)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Request denied:", i)
        }
        time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a rate limiter that allows one request per second, with a burst capacity of five requests. The `Allow()` method checks if a request can proceed.

## Rate Limiting Strategies

The Rate library supports various rate limiting strategies:

1. **Token Bucket**: This strategy allows bursts of traffic while maintaining an average rate over time. It is ideal for scenarios where you want to allow short spikes in requests.
  
2. **Leaky Bucket**: This strategy smooths out bursts by processing requests at a constant rate. It is suitable for applications that require steady traffic flow.

3. **Fixed Window**: This approach limits the number of requests in a fixed time window. It is simple and effective for many use cases.

4. **Sliding Window**: This strategy provides more flexibility by allowing requests to be counted in overlapping time windows. It offers a more granular control over traffic.

## Examples

Here are a few more examples demonstrating different strategies.

### Token Bucket Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/Mahu123-Locked/rate"
)

func main() {
    limiter := rate.NewTokenBucket(2, 5) // 2 tokens per second, burst of 5

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        if limiter.Allow() {
            fmt.Println("Request allowed:", i)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Request denied:", i)
        }
        time.Sleep(300 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

### Leaky Bucket Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/Mahu123-Locked/rate"
)

func main() {
    limiter := rate.NewLeakyBucket(1, 5) // 1 request per second, burst of 5

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        if limiter.Allow() {
            fmt.Println("Request allowed:", i)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Request denied:", i)
        }
        time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```
